            Chandrayaan-3 comprises three main components:

<p>Propulsion Module: The propulsion module will carry the lander and rover configuration till 100 km lunar orbit. It is a box-like structure with one large solar panel mounted on one side and a large cylinder on top (the Intermodular Adapter Cone) that acts as a mounting structure for the lander.

Lander: The lander is responsible for the soft landing on the Moon. It is also box-shaped, with four landing legs and four landing thrusters of 800 newtons each. It will be carrying the rover and various scientific instruments to perform in-site analysis.</p>

<p>The lander for Chandrayaan-3 will have only four throttle-able engines with thrust valve slew rate changing capabilities, unlike Vikram on Chandrayaan-2 which had five 800 Newtons engines with a fifth one being centrally mounted with a fixed thrust. One of the main reasons of Chandrayaan-2 failure, i.e., attitude increase during camera coasting phase was removed by allowing the lander to control attitude and thrust in all phases of descent. Attitude correction range is increased from 10°/s in Chandrayaan-2 to 25°/s in Chandrayaan-3. Additionally, the Chandrayaan-3 lander will be equipped with a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) to allow measuring attitude in 3 directions.[19][20] The impact legs have been made stronger compared to Chandrayaan-2 and instrumentation redundancy has been increased. It will target a more precise 4 km (2.5 mi) by 4 km (2.5 mi) landing region based on images previously provided by OHRC on Chandrayaan-2. ISRO improved the structural rigidity, increased polling in instruments, increased data frequency and transmission and added other multiple software and contingency systems, as the lander is designed to withstand failed landing attempt via multiple complicated software simulations.</p>

<p>Six-wheeled design
Weight of 26 kilograms (57 pounds)
Range of 500 metres (1,600 ft)
Dimensions : 917 millimetres (3.009 ft) x 750 millimetres (2.46 ft) x 397 millimetres (1.302 ft)
The Chandrayaan-3 rover is expected to make a number of important scientific discoveries, including:
The composition of the lunar surface
The presence of water ice in the lunar soil
The history of lunar impacts
The evolution of the Moon’s atmosphere</p>

<p>Lander
Chandra's Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) will measure the thermal conductivity and temperature of the lunar surface.
Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) will measure the seismicity around the landing site.
Langmuir Probe (LP) will estimate the plasma density and its variations.

Rover
Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS) will derive the chemical composition and infer mineralogical composition of the lunar surface.
Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) will determine the elemental composition (Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Fe) of lunar soil and rocks around the lunar landing site.

Propulsion Module
Spectro-polarimetry of Habitable Planet Earth (SHAPE) to study the spectral and polarimetric measurements of Earth from the lunar orbit in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1-1.7 μm).</p>

<p>Launch:
LVM3 M4, Chandrayaan-3 – Launch vehicle lifting off from the Second Launch Pad (SLP) of SDSC-SHAR, Sriharikota
Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST as scheduled, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India. The spacecraft entered lunar orbit on 5 August 2023.It is anticipated that the Chandrayaan-3 mission will achieve a soft landing on the lunar South Pole region on 23 August.

Choosing the month of July for the launch of Chandrayaan 3 was a special move because of a calculation made by ISRO regarding the closeness of Earth and Moon.

On August 5, the Indian Space Research Organisation achieved a Lunar-Orbit Insertion (LOI), successfully placing the Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft into orbit around the Moon. The LOI operation was carried out from the ISRO Telemetry, Tracking, and Command Network (ISTRAC) located in Bengaluru.

After a series of Lunar Bound Maneuvers, on August 17, the Vikram lander separated from the propulsion module, to begin its solo journey to the lunar surface. The next maneuver will be conducted on August 18, which will lower the perigee (closest point) of the orbit in preparation of the landing.</p>
